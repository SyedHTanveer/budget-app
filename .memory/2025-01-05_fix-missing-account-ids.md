## Context## Context



**Problem**: <!-- What problem were you solving? Why did this work need to happen? -->

BalancesSection was only displaying 4 out of 15 linked accounts, while ConnectAccountModal showed all 15 correctly. Both components were calling the same `/api/v1/accounts` endpoint.

**Problem**: 

**Root Cause**: 

12 Plaid accounts from Tartan Bank had NULL `id` fields in the database. The issue occurred because:**Goal**: 

1. The `accounts` table schema uses `table.string('id').primary()` which doesn't auto-generate IDs in SQLite

2. The `plaidService.js` was inserting account records without explicitly providing an `id` field---

3. SQLite allowed NULL values for the primary key (unlike PostgreSQL which would reject this)

## Decisions Made

**Why Only 4 Accounts Showed**:

- ConnectAccountModal deduplicates by `plaid_account_id` (unique for each account) → All 15 showed<!-- Key technical and architectural choices. Focus on "why" not just "what" -->

- BalancesSection deduplicates by `id` → All 12 NULL-id accounts collapsed into one entry in the Map, keeping only the last processed

### 1. [Decision Title]

**Goal**: **Decision**: 

Fix existing NULL ids and prevent future occurrences.

**Reasoning**: 

---- 

- 

## Decisions Made

**Alternatives Considered**: 

### 1. Two-Phase Fix Approach- 

**Decision**: - 

Implement both an immediate data fix AND a code fix to prevent recurrence.

### 2. [Another Decision]

**Reasoning**: ...

- Data fix: Immediately resolves user-facing issue without requiring re-linking accounts

- Code fix: Prevents issue from happening for new account links---

- Together they provide complete remediation

## Features Built

**Alternatives Considered**: 

- Could have just fixed the code and asked users to re-link accounts (poor UX)<!-- What was completed? Be specific about files, endpoints, components -->

- Could have migrated to auto-increment IDs (would require migration across all tables, high risk)

### 1. [Feature/Component Name]

### 2. Use UUID Generation in plaidService- 

**Decision**: - 

Add `const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid')` and include `id: uuidv4()` in `baseRecord` when creating accounts.- 



**Reasoning**: ### 2. [Another Feature]

- Maintains existing string-based UUID pattern used throughout the codebase- 

- Minimal change - only adds one line to account creation- 

- The existing `.onConflict().merge()` already excludes `id` from updates, so won't overwrite existing IDs

---

**Alternatives Considered**: 

- Change table schema to use auto-increment (would require larger migration and rewrite of existing code expecting UUIDs)## What Didn't Work (Optional)

- Use plaid_account_id as primary key (breaks existing foreign key relationships in transactions table)

<!-- Failed experiments, dead ends, approaches that were abandoned -->

### 3. Preserve Original Deduplication Logic

**Decision**: ### [Experiment Name]

Keep BalancesSection deduplicating by `id` rather than changing to `plaid_account_id`.**Tried**: 



**Reasoning**: **Result**: 

- `id` is the correct primary key for the accounts table

- Once IDs are properly populated, deduping by `id` is the right approach**Why it failed**: 

- Changing to `plaid_account_id` would mask the underlying data integrity issue

**Learning**:

## Changes Made

## Next Steps

### 1. Database Fix

**File**: One-time Node.js script (executed via terminal)<!-- What's incomplete? What should be done next? -->



**Actions**:### Immediate

- Queried for all accounts with NULL or empty `id` values (found 12)- [ ] 

- Generated new UUID for each using `uuidv4()`- [ ] 

- Updated database records using SQLite3 via Node.js

### Future

**Verification**:- [ ] 

```bash- [ ] 

sqlite3 budget_app.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM accounts WHERE id IS NULL OR id = ''"

# Result: 0 (down from 12)---

```

## Open Questions

### 2. Code Fix - plaidService.js

**File**: `backend/src/services/plaidService.js`<!-- Unresolved issues, decisions that need input, technical unknowns -->



**Changes**:1. **[Question]**

1. Added import: `const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid')`   - Context: 

2. Modified `baseRecord` in account insertion loop to include:   - Options: 

   ```javascript   - Needs: 

   id: uuidv4(), // Generate UUID for new accounts

   ```---



**Impact**: All future Plaid account links will have proper UUIDs from the start.## Related Files



### 3. Cleanup - BalancesSection.tsx<!-- Link to relevant files, memory files, or external docs -->

**File**: `ledgr.ai-frontend/src/components/dashboard/BalancesSection.tsx`

- `path/to/file.js`

**Changes**:- `.memory/YYYY-MM-DD_related-work.md`

- Removed temporary debug console.log statements added during investigation- [External doc](https://example.com)

- Kept existing duplicate detection warning (useful for future debugging)

## Notes

## Testing & Verification

<!-- Any additional context, gotchas, or reminders for future work -->

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. ✅ Verified NULL id count dropped to 0 after data fix- 

2. ✅ Checked backend server is running with nodemon (auto-reload for code changes)- 

3. ✅ User should refresh BalancesSection and see all 15 accounts displayed

### Expected Behavior:
- **Before**: 4 accounts (Chase Checking, Savings Account, Credit Card, Plaid Student Loan)
- **After**: All 15 accounts including all Plaid Tartan Bank accounts

## Related Files

### Modified:
- `backend/src/services/plaidService.js` - Added UUID generation
- `ledgr.ai-frontend/src/components/dashboard/BalancesSection.tsx` - Removed debug logs

### Reviewed:
- `backend/src/seeds/001_sample_data.js` - Already uses explicit UUIDs (good!)
- `backend/src/migrations/20240101000001_initial_schema.js` - Schema uses string IDs, not auto-increment

---

## Lessons & Improvements

### What Worked Well:
- Debug logging in BalancesSection quickly revealed deduplication was collapsing entries
- ConnectAccountModal comparison showed same endpoint returned 15 accounts, proving API was correct
- Direct database inspection with SQLite3 immediately revealed the NULL id issue

### Future Improvements:
- **Migration Enhancement**: Consider adding a migration to set `NOT NULL` constraint on `accounts.id` to prevent this at schema level (would need data fix first, which is now done)
- **Validation**: Add API-level validation to reject account inserts without valid UUIDs
- **Testing**: Add integration test that verifies account insertion includes proper UUIDs

### Similar Patterns to Check:
Other tables use `table.string('id').primary()` pattern:
- `users`
- `plaid_items`
- `transactions`
- `bills`

**Recommendation**: Audit other services that insert into these tables to ensure they all explicitly provide UUIDs. The seed file already does this correctly, but check for other insertion points.

## Follow-up Tasks

- [ ] Consider adding schema-level `NOT NULL` constraint on `accounts.id` (requires migration)
- [ ] Audit other table insertion points for missing UUID generation
- [ ] Add integration test for Plaid account linking that validates account IDs are populated
- [ ] Document UUID requirement in developer guide

---

## Notes

- The issue only affected Plaid-linked accounts, not manually created accounts (seed data had explicit IDs)
- SQLite's permissiveness with NULL primary keys is different from PostgreSQL behavior - keep this in mind for production
- The `accounts_user_id_plaid_account_id_unique` constraint is working correctly; issue was solely with missing IDs on insert
